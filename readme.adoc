= Jekyll Site Search Data Generator

## Description

A small script that generates json suitable for Solr from the Community
Site/Static content Jekyll site.

## Installation and usage

This tool is run by a build hook in Jekyll and expects to be run from the
root directory of a Jekyll site.  It is piped Jekyll output pages directly and
writes those pages to `solr.json` and `batch.json` in the built site's
`_site/api/v1` directory.
